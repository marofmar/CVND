"""
#30DaysofUdacity #CVND #PractiveMakesPerfect I practiced implementing codes for image processing.
- I took a lecture of YOLO. I heard of the impressive name, but never took time to seriously figure out what this is. So, basically this was the first time ever studying this subject. 
- Also tried to implement denormalizing codes for 3rd notebook in Facial Key points Detection project. I only multiplied 225 to the output, but maybe should use the (x,y,w,h) from the Haar Cascades output
- I watched a Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning  video, Lecture1. I should keep watching this great series one each day.
