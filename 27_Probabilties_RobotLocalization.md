# Day 27/30 CVND (Computer Vision Nanodegree)
## Lesson2: Robot Localization 

#### 4. Probability Distribution
- Prior: a prior probability distribution of an uncertain quantity/ Express one's belief before some measurement or evidence is taken into account.
- Posterior: the probability distribution of an uncertain quantity after some evidence have been taken into account

#### 5. Localization 
- GPS: Global Positioning System (not accurate. 2-10 m errors common) 
- "How can we know where we are in an environment with 10cm accuracy?" 

#### 6. Total Probability 
- uniform = maximum confusion 
- Increased belief, decreased belief: Posterior belief
- Convolution 
- Posterior * Prior = Posterior
